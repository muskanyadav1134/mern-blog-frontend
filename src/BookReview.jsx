      <p>
        *A Thousand Splendid Suns* by Khaled Hosseini is a gripping, emotionally resonant novel
        that tells the intertwined stories of Mariam and Laila—two women from different backgrounds
        whose lives become inextricably linked through tragedy, hope, and resilience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The novel explores themes of female friendship, endurance in the face of brutality,
        the complexities of war-torn Afghanistan, and the strength found in love and sacrifice.
        Hosseini's storytelling is deeply human, intimate, and poetic.
